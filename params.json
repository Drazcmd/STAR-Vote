{"name":"STAR-Vote","tagline":"The secure, transparent, auditable, reliable electronic voting system","body":"## Security\r\nEnd-to-end ElGamal, homomorphic tallying, redundant verifiable logs ensure that election software is 100% secure, from the opening of the polls to the last vote counted. \r\n\r\n## Transparency\r\nSTAR-Vote is an open source project, and we invite anyone to inspect, evaluate, and offer improvements to our code. In addition to our code, the elections run with this software are entirely transparent, and implementation of the Benaloh challenge model allow any voter to verify that their vote is cast as intended. Election results are also verifiable via the Audit Bulletin board, on to which every cast vote is posted anonymously for public verification of the vote tally. \r\n\r\n## Auditing\r\nThrough the use of homomorphic tallying, STAR-Vote's election results are entirely verifiable by third party independent entities. The voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) also adheres to the latest VVSG standards for improving the election audit process. The use of risk limiting audits also greatly empowers election officials and third parties alike to perform full, statistically viable audits with minimum effort. \r\n\r\n## Reliability\r\nCoded in Java, STAR-Vote fully utilizes the write once, run anywhere philosophy, and is compatible with Windows, Linux, and OS X. Voter-end user interfaces are entirely pre-rendered, reducing the load on terminal hardware and allow for robust voting sessions with multiple ballots and ballot formats. Full ballot printouts assure voters that their vote was counted, as a paper copy of every cast ballot is stored in a secure ballot box. Redundancy of network messages on every machine promises that no message goes unheard.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
