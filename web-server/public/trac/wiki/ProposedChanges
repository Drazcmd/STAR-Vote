These changes proposed based on the July 5 meeting.

 * Queue for application level messages
  * Pair {from (host ptr), message}
 * Events for connection-level stuff:
  * Incomming connection
  * Lost connection
 * Certificates need to be stored so that a later call by the application can retrieve it.

Structural changes to auditorium messages based on discussion:

 * A certificate is a signed triple: (id, key, annotation).
 * A signature is a triple: (id, sig-data, payload).
 * A key is a pair: (mod, exp).
 * A host pointer is a triple: (id, ip, port).
 * A message pointer is a triple: (id, sequence, hash)
