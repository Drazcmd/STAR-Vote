== Top Level Overview ==
The !LayoutManager has one main purpose purposes: to produce a Layout that corresponds to a given Ballot.  As such, it is specified by the ILayoutManager interface, whose one method makeLayout does exactly that.  A concrete implementation of the !LayoutManager may use any number of ways to lay out its pages, and may create whatever pages it likes.  A standard method, used by the ALayoutManager abstract class and the [VoteBoxPrepTool/PsychLayout PsychLayoutManager] implementation, uses Swing's !GridBagLayout to position the elements on a frame, and then copying the positions where they end up onto the elements themselves.

== ALayoutManager ==
The ALayoutManager abstract class specifies some abstract methods that help divide up the work that is done laying out each Page, and putting all of the Pages together to make the Layout.  There is a method for each type of Page (see below for types), and there is also a method for each type of Card ([VoteBoxPrepTool/Model#Card see also]).  So if, for instance, a designer wanted to move the review screen before the races (the "Direct Access" model), he could subclass an existing implementation and override the makeLayout method such that the races were placed after the review screen in page order.  More importantly, all other elements of the existing superclass would not need to be changed.  This provides very good extensibility - should the designer wish to write a new or modified !LayoutManager, he would simply need to extend the appropriate class, and modify the appropriate methods.

See the ALayoutManager Javadoc for more specific descriptions of methods.

=== Types of Pages ===
There are several types of pages that an ALayoutManager can lay out.  They include the following:

 Instructions Page::
  A page with instructions for the user on how to use the voting machine
 Card Page::
  A page with a Card on it (such as a race or proposition)
 Review Page::
  A page with all of the cards on it and the users' selections, plus the ability to go back and make a change
 Record Page::
  A page that confirms with the user that he is finished making changes to his ballot selections
 Success Page::
  A page that informs the user that his ballot was cast successfully.

In addition to the above, an ALayoutManager has visitor methods for an ACard that allow it to lay out any type of Card (this is called by the makeCardPage method).
