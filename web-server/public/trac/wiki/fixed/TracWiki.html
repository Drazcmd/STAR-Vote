Trac has a built-in wiki system which you can use for organizing knowledge and information in a very flexible way by <a class="wiki" href="WikiNewPage.html" rel="follow">creating pages</a> containing an intuitive and easy to learn textual markup. This text markup is also used in all other parts of the system, not only in <a class="wiki" href="TitleIndex.html" rel="follow">wiki pages</a>, but also in <a class="wiki" href="TracTickets.html" rel="follow">ticket</a> description and comments, <a class="wiki" href="TracChangeset.html" rel="follow">check-in log messages</a>, <a class="wiki" href="TracRoadmap.html" rel="follow">milestone</a> descriptions and <a class="wiki" href="TracReports.html" rel="follow">report</a> descriptions, even in third-party extensions.
It allows for formatted text and hyperlinks in and between all Trac modules.
</p>
<p>
Editing wiki text is easy, using any web browser and a simple <a class="wiki" href="WikiFormatting.html" rel="follow">formatting system</a>, rather than more complex markup languages like HTML.  The reasoning behind its design is that HTML, with its large collection of nestable tags, is too complicated to allow fast-paced editing, and distracts from the actual content of the pages. Note though that Trac also supports <a class="wiki" href="WikiHtml.html" rel="follow">HTML</a>, <a class="wiki" href="WikiRestructuredText.html" rel="follow">reStructuredText</a> and <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/"><span class="icon">​</span>Textile</a> as alternative markup formats, which can eventually be used in parts of a page (so called wiki blocks).
</p>
<p>
The main goal of the wiki is to make editing text easier and <em>encourage</em> people to contribute and annotate text content for a project. Trac also provides a simple toolbar to make formatting text even easier, and supports the <a class="ext-link" href="http://universaleditbutton.org/Universal_Edit_Button"><span class="icon">​</span>universal edit button</a> of your browser.
</p>
<p>
The wiki itself does not enforce any structure, but rather resembles a stack of empty sheets of paper, where you can organize information and documentation as you see fit, and later reorganize if necessary. 
As contributing to a wiki is essentially building hypertext, 
general advice regarding HTML authoring apply here as well.
For example, the <em><a class="ext-link" href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style"><span class="icon">​</span>Style Guide for online hypertext</a></em> explains how to think about the
<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/Structure.html"><span class="icon">​</span>overall structure of a work</a> 
and how to organize information <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/WithinDocument.html"><span class="icon">​</span>within each document</a>. One of the most important tip is make your HTML page such that you can read it even if you don't follow any links.

Before saving your changes, you can <em>Preview</em> the page or <em>Review the Changes</em> you've made.
You can get an automatic preview of the formatting as you type when you activate the <em>Edit Side-by-side</em> mode (you have to Preview the page for the setting to take effect). <em> There is a <a class="wiki" href="TracIni#trac-section.html" rel="follow">configurable delay</a> between when you make your edit and when the automatic preview will update.</em>
