<h2 id="SDLUserInterface">SDL User Interface</h2>
<p>
<a class="missing wiki" href="/wiki/VoteBox" rel="nofollow">VoteBox?</a> can be launched with a minimalist UI which makes use of the Simple <a class="missing wiki" href="/wiki/DirectMedia" rel="nofollow">DirectMedia?</a> Layer.  By using this view, <a class="missing wiki" href="/wiki/VoteBox" rel="nofollow">VoteBox?</a> can be run without depending on a window manager (such as X.org).  The library required for this is SDL_wrap, a custom wrapper of SDL; which makes use of SWIG for marshalling between Java and C.  SDL_wrap is only ment to be used on Linux systems running without a window manager, although a .dll is included (and will build) known issues exist on Windows.
</p>
<p>
To use the SDL UI, the VIEW_IMPLEMENTATION must be set to SDL in the appropriate .conf file:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">VIEW_IMPLEMENTATION
SDL
</pre><p>
Additionally, libSDL_wrap.so must be in your Java library path, or passed as such on the command line:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">java -Djava.library.path=my/path/to/lib/SDL_wrap/folder -jar ...
</pre>
