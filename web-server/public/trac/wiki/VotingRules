= pre-flight checks = 

 * Check for valid Auditorium message format
 * Check validity of signatures
 * Construct & validate DAG (message hash checking)
 * [for Scott's verifier] ensure that, for a host A, each message Ai succeeds all messages A(k<i) and precedes all messages A(k > i)
 * [for Scott's verifier] There exists exactly one message with each sequence number for each host (within seq. no. bounds).

= voting validity rules =

 * '''General'''
  * For each `polls-open`, there is exactly one `polls-closed` that '''succeeds''' it. Similarly, for each `polls-closed`, there is exactly one `polls-open` that '''precedes''' it.
  * For each message of type (`authorized-to-cast`, `override-cast`, `override-cancel`, `ballot-received`, `last-polls-open`, `cast-ballot`, `override-cast-confirm`, `override-cast-deny`, `override-cancel-confirm`, `override-cancel-deny`): it must occur '''between''' the `polls-open` and `polls-closed` messages.
 * '''Votes'''
  * Each `authorized-to-cast` message must contain a ''unique'' `authorization-code`.
  * For each message of type (`cast-ballot`, `override-cast`, `override-cancel`): 
   * it must succeed an `authorized-to-cast` message with the same `authorization-code`.
   * there must not exist any other message of type (`cast-ballot`, `override-cast`, `override-cancel`) with the same `authorization-code`.
   * if it is of type (`cast-ballot` or `override-cast`) then it must be succeeded by a `ballot-received` message from the supervisor.  (Reverse: all `ballot-received` must succeed a `cast-ballot` or `override-cast`.)
  * Overrides:
   * Each `override-cast` must be succeeded by exactly one of (`override-cast-confirm`, `override-cast-deny`) with the same `authorization-code`. 
   * Each `override-cancel` must be succeeded by exactly one of (`override-cancel-confirm`, `override-cancel-deny`) with the same `authorization-code`
   * Similarly, each confirmation must succeed exactly one override message.
 * '''Booths'''
  * For each booth,
   * All "vote authorization intervals" (that is, interval between `authorized-to-cast` and one of (`cast-ballot` or `override-cast` or `override-cancel`)) must be non-overlapping.
 * '''Node types'''
  * All `supervisor` messages are signed with a certificate that belongs to a ''supervisor''.
  * All `votebox` messages are signed with a certificate that belongs to a ''booth''.
