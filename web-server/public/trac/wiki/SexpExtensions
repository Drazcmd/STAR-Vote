Because the verifier will need to provide a way for the rule writer to express wildcards in his expressions, we have to make a few extensions to the s-expression human readable format. 

 * '''Any Expression:''' #any
 * '''Any String:''' #string
 * '''Any List:''' #list
 * '''Any list that conforms to a pattern:''' #listof:<pattern>
