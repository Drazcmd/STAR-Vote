== Simple Election == 
A simple election is one featuring only Supervisor and !VoteBox machines (encryption is optional as well).  Any configuration files WITHOUT USE_COMMIT_CHALLENGE_MODEL set to true can be used in a Simple Election (they must, however, be consistent between Supervisor and !VoteBoxes).  The precompile ballot used in this example can be found [attachment:presidential-only-simple.bal.zip here], the .bal used to generate it is [attachment:presidential-only.bal here].

== Walkthrough ==
 * Place supervisor.jar & votebox.jar on seperate machines.  Any number of each may be in use, provided there is no more than one per machine and at least one of each on the network.
 * Start the supervisor and votebox jars
  * Instructions may be found [VoteBoxSupervisor here] and [VoteBoxRunTime here], respectively.
 * While the auditorium network is being established and discovery is ongoing, you will see the following screens on supervisors and voteboxes respectively.

 * When a Supervisor discovers its first !VoteBox the screen changes to one similar to this.
